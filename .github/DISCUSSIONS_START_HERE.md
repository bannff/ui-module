# Discussions: “Start here” (copy/paste)

## Start here: How we work in this repo

This repo follows the SoleraX workflow:

- **Issues** = track work with acceptance criteria.
- **Projects** = plan and visualize status.
- **Discussions** = design/RFC/Q&A threads.
- **PRs** = the only way code lands on `main`.

### Where should I post?

- If you have a concrete change to make: open an **Issue**.
- If you’re unsure about the approach, need consensus, or want to propose something: open a **Discussion**.
- If you have code ready: open a **PR** and link the Issue.

### Suggested Discussion categories

We use categories (not folders) to organize threads:

- `Announcements` (pinned updates)
- `Design` (architecture/ADR drafts)
- `RFC` (proposals needing review)
- `How-To` (runbooks / dev workflow tips)
- `Q&A` (questions)

### First steps for a new contributor

1. Read the README and project setup.
2. Check the Project board for what’s in progress.
3. If you’re starting new work: open an Issue with a clear definition of done.
